## PG6102 - Boat navigation

#### Modules
* `api-gateway`
* `port`
* `rest-dto`
* `shared-dto`
* `boat`
* `crew`
* `trip`

#### About the project
The project features a boat navigation system, with a microservice architecture. `port`, `boat` and `crew` are services that indipendently handle relevant data. The `trip` module fetches data from the three aforementioned modules while using a circuit breaker and WireMock for testing.

`shared-dto` contains DTO-objects shared between the different microservices. `rest-dto` contains utilities used by the REST-controllers. `api-gateway` acts as a single entrypoint for when the application is dockerized, and utilizes consul discovery and a load balancer acting on the different microservices.

As for test coverage, all testable services exceed 70% total test coverage.

#### Use

`docker compose up --build` will dockerize the application and build the services, while exposing `localhost:80` as a single entrypoint for the entire application.

The services are also equipped with a `LocalApplicationRunner.kt`, that, like the name implies, run the services locally with an embedded database (H2) initialized by Flyway. The documentation UI generated by Swagger is located on http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/ after starting the services locally.

##### Evaluation

Requirements for R1 are met. All requirements for R2 are met, except for the last point, and the same goes for T1 and T2.
